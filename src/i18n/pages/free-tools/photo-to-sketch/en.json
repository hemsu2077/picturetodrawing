      {
        "title": "How long does it take to convert a photo to sketch?",
        "description": "The photo to sketch conversion typically takes 40-50 seconds for standard images. Processing time may extend to 60-70 seconds for larger photos or high-resolution images, as all computation happens in your browser. The speed depends on your device's processing power and the image complexity. For faster cloud-based processing (20-30 seconds), try our premium AI drawing generator."
      },
      {
        "title": "Why doesn't my sketch look good? How can I improve results?",
        "description": "The quality of your photo to sketch conversion depends heavily on your original image. For best results, use high-resolution photos with clear subjects and good lighting. Blurry or low-quality images will produce less detailed sketches. If you're not satisfied with the free tool's output, try our AI picture to drawing generator on the homepage - it offers advanced algorithms, multiple pencil sketch styles, and professional-quality results. You can try it free once daily without login."
      },
      {
        "title": "What types of photos work best for sketch conversion?",
        "description": "Photos with clear subjects and strong contrast produce the best pencil sketch results. Portraits with good lighting, pet photos with defined features, and landscapes with distinct elements work exceptionally well. The free photo to sketch tool automatically detects edges and converts them into sketch lines, so images with well-defined boundaries yield cleaner, more artistic results."
